\section{Problem Description}
While plants using fossil fuels or nuclear power are outputting high voltage AC directly into the grid the renewable sources need converters before they can feed their energy into the grid.
Solar panels produce very low power DC-voltage.
To output the power to the grid the voltage of the solar panels needs to be increased.
That can be archived by connecting more panels in series or using boost converters.
When using the panels in series the resistance increases and the output power will be reduced.

Using boost converters is the better solution but the standard boost converter topology is not suitable for this case.
As the voltage difference between the output of the solar power to the grid is very big it can not convert it in one step.
So cascaded converters are used but they still have to always run on high duty cycles as the conversion ratio must be very high. 

New topologies for boost converters can have advantages over the conventional boost converters when it comes to efficiency and durability.
