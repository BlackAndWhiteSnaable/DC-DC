\section{Problem Definition}\label{sec:probdesc}
The goal of this report is to compare different DC-DC boost converter topologies and choose the one most suitable for PV appliances. The chosen circuit should be tested in both simulations and hardware. The comparison of the results to the requirements that will be set in Sections \ref{sec:req} will determine weather the project is a success.
