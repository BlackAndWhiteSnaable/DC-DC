\section{Topology Comparison}\label{ch:CBC}

After the conventional boost converter has been analyzed and verified,
three other topologies are described by the group prior to the 2Nx Interleaved Boost Converter. These three topologies are essential for understanding of the final presented converter. They are presented as Switched Inductor Boost Converter, Single Switch Quadratic Boost Converter and Conventional Three Level Boost Converter. The operation of all three topologies is described in the different switching modes and their converion ratios are derived using the KVL method. In addition, the topologies are built and simulated on MATLAB and all the results are verified.
