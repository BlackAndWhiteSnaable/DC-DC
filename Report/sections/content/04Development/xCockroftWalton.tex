The Cockroft-Walton Boost Converter (CWBC) utilises passive components to multiply the output voltage of a CBC.
To achieve this the CWBC employs a Cockroft-Walton Half-Wave Multiplicator (CWHWM) instead of the output capacitor.
A general schematic of the CWHWM can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:CWHWM}.

The figure shows a three stage CWHWM,
with the third stage marked with a blue box.
Since all stages are equal and just appended to the previous,
more stages can be added at the dotted lines.
