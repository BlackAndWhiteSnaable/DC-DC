\todo[color=c05c,inline]{testing the colors}

To be able to test the proposed topology,
a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) had to be made.
We got some guidance in this process by Sagar Mahajal,\todo[color=c05c]{reference him?}.
a Ph.D. student working on the same project.

Because this circuit is designed for power electronics,
some different precautions had to be made from conventional PCB design.
The copper traces had to be wide enough to accommodate the currents going through
and spaced apart enough to prevent the potential difference from sparking over.
