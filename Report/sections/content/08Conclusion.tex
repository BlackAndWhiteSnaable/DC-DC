Based on the requirements stated in Section \ref{sec:req}, the project can be described as successful as the group was able to first analyze and then implement a prototype of the 2Nx Interleaved Boost Converter.

Firstly, the equations for all the topologies from which the 2Nx MBC is derived from, were expresed. In addition, all topologies were modelled and simulated on both Matlab and LTSpice for verification of the results. This helped for better understanding of the different boost converter topologies as well as the final topology presented.

After feeling comfortable with the basic boost converter topologies, the 2Nx Interleaved Boost Converter was analyzed with derivation of its conversion ratio. Also, mathematical expressions for calculating the drops across the diodes and switches was also developed and verified with LTSpice.

Finally, the boost converter was implemented with the selected components as described in Chapter \ref{ch:implement}. The converter was tested on different duty cycles and the data was gethered for verification with the LTSpice simulations.

Overall, it can be observed that there are additional voltage drops between the implementation and the simulation results. These differences have been discussed in the Discussion (Section \ref{ch:Discussion}). Possible solutions and further improvements are suggested in Section \ref{ch:conclusion}.
