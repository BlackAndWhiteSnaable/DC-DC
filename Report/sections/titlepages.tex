}{% the abstract
	This report focuses on developing and testing a suitable DC-DC converter for PV applications.
	
	The main goal is to analyse, simulate and compare different topologies and choose the most efficient one. The chosen topology has been tested in hardware as well, to determine its real world viability and how accurate simulations are compared to real measurements.
	The topology chosen has gain 6 times higher on all duty ratios compared to the conventional boost converter. 

	For simulation the tools used are SIMULINK and LTSpice. For the hardware test a custom PCB has been designed and printed with a SKYPER driver board being used to operate the circuit.
